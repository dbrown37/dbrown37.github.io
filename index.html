								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							

							<p align="left">During my time in Undergrad I was a Physic/Astronomy Major doing some work in data analysis on HII regions.  I found myself drawn to the Data Analysis part of things but ultimately found my niche in the role of making the training materials for future students who will be working in that role.  I felt as though that would be one of the more lasting impacts I could make in this role and the best way I could use my skills to build up the program moving forward.  A few months after this job ended, I saw a role on Campus with the University's Online Content development office, known as Academic Innovations at the time.  They were looking for a Computer Science student to help with the transfer of 1500+ online courses from one Learning Management system to another.  While I wasn't a computer science student I felt as though my computer skills I had built during my time doing Computational Physics would be as good fit for this role. </p> 
							
							
							<p align=left>I was hired and started working as an undergrad working among a team of Instructional and Curriculum designers as a kind of apprentice. I started with purely the management side of things on the LMS but started working more with the designers and SMEs to develop more content and classes.  

								I stayed in this role for the remainder of my time in Undergrad and was offered a graduate assistantship if I pursued a degree in Instructional Design.  I started working with professors and Administration directly to build new courses and help plan the curriculum for new programs.  I felt this role at the University was a great position to be in to impact significant change of the direction of the University.  Online education, at the time, was not the primary form of course delivery at the university, but many of the courses I built or assisted on during this time were still being offered when WVU shifted to being online during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
								
								I left this graduate assistantship around halfway through my degree program for another graduate student job at the College of Education and human services.  Here I was developing training modules for new and in-service WV educators designed to help them maintain and build their research method skills.  While at this position I was offered my first full time ID job at the College of Business and Economics at WVU. 
								
							</p>
							<p align=left>During my time at B&E WVU I helped bring 3 new programs online, Business Law, Cybersecurity, and Business Data Analytics.  I built upwards of 70 courses during my time here and most of them were in these three programs.  It felt great to be a part of the new wave of technology sweeping over academia and started to build my desire for IoT, AR/VR, and the role of bleeding edge tech could play in education.  
								
							</p><p align="left">In March of 2021 I left WVU and academia for an Instructional Designer role at a software company based out of Boston called PTC.  Here I create training for developers for the various software used by PTC, primarily their IoT software known as ThingWorx, but also develop content for their CAD software Creo, and their AR/VR app, Vuforia.  My time in the role allowed me to devote a lot of time to learning various new technologies and creating 60-minute eLearning, 1â€“2-minute tutorials, as well as creating/teaching the content for 3-hour VILT training.  This role has allowed me to grow and work better in an industry environment where the pace is a lot faster than academia and you're on the timeframe for development of content updates, of SaaS updates, which happen at nearly any moment.</p>
